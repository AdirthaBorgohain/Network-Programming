# Network-Programming
This repo consists of script files primarily used for socket programming.

#### The Problems: 

1. Write a program to run TCP client and server socket programs where client first says "Hi" and in response server says "Hello".

2. Write a program using TCP socket to implement the following:

        i. Server maintains records of fruits in the format: fruit-name quantity Last-sold (server timestamp), 

        ii. Multiple client purchase the fruits one at a time,

        iii. The fruit quantity is updated each time any fruit is sold, 

        iv. Show warning messages to the client if the quantity requested is not available. 

        v. Display the customer ids <IP, port> who has done transactions already. This list should be updated in the server everytime a transaction occurs.

        vi. The total number of unique customers who did some transaction will be displayed to the customer everytime.

3. Redo problem no. 1 using UDP socket.

4. Create a math server where the client sends a computational problem which is solved and sent back by the server.

5. Redo problem 2 using python

6. Create a group-chat program where several clients can connect to a server and communicate among themselves.

7. Create a one to one chat program where the clients provide their own ids and communicate with each other with their corresponding ids.
